<h1>4. Improve Friendships</h1>
<p>Currently I'm in job-hunting mode living at my mums and working a whole bunch, so this looks like a few weekly calls with friends, a fortnightly call with my <a href="https://www.microsolidarity.cc/" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline;">microsolidarity</a> crew, and that's kinda it. I'm doing weekly "coaching" with a few friends where I hold space for them each week and they set themselves homework for next week and know they'll have accountability, it works really well. I love being helpful!</p>
