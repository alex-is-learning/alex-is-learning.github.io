<h1>My favourites</h1>
<p>I thought I'd add links to some of my favourite things on the internet. But
I'm currently writing this on my "no internet browser, no nothing" Arch Linux
ThinkPad, so, no links right now!</p>
<h2>Favourite blog posts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sasha's Chapin's "Notes Against Note-Taking Systems</li>
      <li>(did this indent correctly?) Great short treatus on the perils of
          being nerd-sniped, being left-hemisphere captured and in
          optimiser/yak-shaving mode, rather than just making stuff. "Most great
          writing comes from channeling what is in the air at this very moment",
          or something to that affect. (Effect? Man, writing with no internet is
          hard, lol).
  <li>Michael Nielsen's "Augmenting Long-Term Memory" - the best write up about
  anki I've seen. Memorisation gets a very bad rap but is so so underrated and
  essential IMO.</li>
  <li>Sasha Chapin's "Loving Awareness as Anti-Meme" - love this concept, and
      love the description of how all spiritual/mystical traditions seem to
      converge at the same point. 
</ul>
<p>There's more but I'll leave it there for now...
