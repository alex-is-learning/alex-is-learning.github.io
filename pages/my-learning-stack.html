    <h1>My Learning Stack</h1>
    <p>This page is a work in progress. Here I'll document the tools, workflows, and resources I use to learn effectively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note-taking:</strong> Obsidian, with the Breadcrumbs v4 plugin (essential!!)</li>
      <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Anki</li>
      <li><strong>Learning Aid</strong> Gemini Deep Research</li> 
      <li><strong>Goal Tracking:</strong> Beeminder, Toggl Track</li>
      <li><strong>Reading:</strong> reMarkable, Speechify</li>
      <li><strong>Task Management:</strong> Obsidian "Tasks" plugin, Intend.do</li>
      <li><strong>Writing & Reflection:</strong> Neovim, Substack</li>
    </ul>

    <div>
      <h3><a href="https://speechify.com/" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline;">Speechify</a></h3>
      <p>A tool that reads text aloud, both via PDFs and the Chrome extension. If I generate a Deep Research review on a topic, I'll then export the PDF, put it into Speechify, put it on my reMarkable tablet, and then read on the reMarkable whilst Speechify reads it out loud to me. This massively reduces time required to read, but actually IMO the most profound benefit isn't increased reading speed, it's the ability to read for much longer periods because you use significantly less willpower when something else sets the pace for you.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline;">reMarkable 2</a> (often used with Speechify)</h3>
      <p>As discussed in the Speechify section. It's a really great A4-ish sized e-ink reader. Great for highlighting PDFs, scribbling in the margins. I really like how "dumb" it is, although sometimes I do wish I had an iPad. It's great for not adding to eye strain though, no backlight, e-ink screen.</p>

      <p>Switched back to this tool after some time away. [cite: 2] It's considered much better for long-form writing and thinking, offering a faster thinking process compared to more graphical tools like Miro for certain tasks. [cite: 2] It allows for easily typing and creating new documents. [cite: 2] Also seen as great for gathering questions, thinking about different topics, and formulating questions. [cite: 2]</p>

      <h3><a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline;">Miro</a></h3>
      <p>Described as a hugely underrated tool for thinking. [cite: 2] It's a 2D, infinite canvas that's great due to its spatial nature, suiting how our brains work. [cite: 2] It allows the use of color, size, and post-it notes for organizing tasks and thoughts. [cite: 2] However, setting it up can be cumbersome, laborious, and mouse-heavy. [cite: 2]</p>

      <h3><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:underline;">Anki</a></h3>
      <p>A flashcard tool. While the user questions its fit for the audience's potential use cases (imagining they learn easily in their core areas due to rich existing knowledge graphs [cite: 2]), it's highlighted as amazing for learning something new or tackling the "cold start problem" by guaranteeing a good foundation (e.g., learning about John Boyd, Heidegger, AI safety [cite: 2]). It's based on the idea that "Anki makes memory a choice, rather than a haphazard event" (citing Michael Nielsen [cite: 2]). It could be used for remembering anything reliably, such as names from conferences or details about contacts. [cite: 2]</p>
