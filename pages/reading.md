---

# What I'm studying
- [Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd by Frans Osinga](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Strategy-War-History/dp/0415459524)
    - Reading this very slowly/deeply by using it as a jumping off point for making dozens of deep research reports & _loads_ of flashcards
- [Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics, and Society by Dan Hendrycks](https://www.aisafetybook.com/)
    - Really really great primer. I'm reading it slowly and making a bunch of flashcards. 
- [Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella Meadows](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Systems-Primer-Donella-Meadows/dp/1603580557)
    - As described, a really great primer !!

## Deep research reports
- Folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F7RfZteQJKsMI-cVux-YYFcLrnbeXd1f?usp=sharing)
- It's so insanely useful for quick primers and jumping off points. Feels truly revolutionary

## What I'm dipping into 
- [Awakening From the Meaning Crisis: Part One: Origins (John Vervaeke)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Awakening-Meaning-Crisis-Part-Origins/dp/1645011003)
    - Really excited that they've made a book out of the [50 hour lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ), much easier to learn from IMO

## For fun (not studying, reading in a chill paperback way)
- Paperback in the evening: [Alex's Adventures in Numberland: Dispatches from the Wonderful World of Mathematics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alexs-Adventures-Numberland-Alex-Bellos/dp/1408809591)
    - I heard that this is a great book for getting interested in maths and it's true, it's pretty great so far.

## Paused
- Hubert Dreyfus' "[Being-in-the-World](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Being-World-Commentary-Heideggers-Division/dp/0262540568)" Heidegger primer. Shifted to Vervaeke instead. I do love Dreyfus though
