# My favourites

I thought I'd add links to some of my favourite things on the internet. But I'm currently writing this on my "no internet browser, no nothing" Arch Linux ThinkPad, so, no links right now!

## Favourite blog posts

- Sasha's Chapin's "[Notes Against Note-Taking Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems)"
    - Great short treatus on the perils of being nerd-sniped, being left-hemisphere captured and in optimiser/yak-shaving mode, rather than just making stuff. "Most great writing comes from channeling what is in the air at this very moment", or something to that affect. (Effect? Man, writing with no internet is hard, lol).
- Michael Nielsen's "[Augmenting Long-Term Memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)" - the best write up about anki I've seen. Memorisation gets a very bad rap but is so so underrated and essential IMO.
- [Sasha Chapin's "Loving Awareness as Anti-Meme](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/loving-awareness-as-anti-meme)" - love this concept, and love the description of how all spiritual/mystical traditions seem to converge at the same point.
