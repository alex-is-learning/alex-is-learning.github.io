# 2025-06-09 - Beginning learning from Osinga chapter 4

I tried starting by giving the chapter to Gemini 2.5 and saying "please make high level flashcards from this chapter", but that made me realise that there are things that I need to run specific Deep Research reports on, to learn them properly. 

E.g., "complex adaptive systems" aren't fully explained in Osinga chapter 4, so I'm going to run a report, read & make flashcards from this, and then probably make some additional reports from things surfaced by that report...
