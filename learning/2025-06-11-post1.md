As per my [blog post from today](/blog/2025-06-11/), I wanna start predicting way more things, particularly other people's world models. 

I have a sense that this is gonna be kinda painful/embarrassing at first. But I can totally imagine it becoming fun and addictive like Defender of Basic says it became for him. 

The main question for me right now is -- where to begin?? What world views to try to predict?? 

Do I choose a tpot-y, post-rat-y person that I follow and dig through their tweets? 
Do I find someone ranting about politics? 
Do I find someone who has been tweeting about stuff I've been learning about recently?

Ok... I'm definitely noticing that, looking through my list of tpot people who I follow, that no one really feels like a good fit...
Either they're a big account who won't reply, or they're someone who I'm like "idk, because they're post-rat, they may be more vibes-based anyway, where they won't have a clear world model/stance". This is probabyl dumb because I guess everyone has justifications for things, even if they're hazy. There's also a sense of not wanting to "shit where I eat", re: becoming an annoying tpot reply guy who asks tpot people "why do you think that?" all the time, lol...

Damnit how do I find people. I think I need to leave the tpot zone, I've half-typed a few replies to tweets by a few people who I follow and just felt too insufferable lol. B/c tpot is vibes-based, replies like "do you think that because x" does feel very annoying (I've also received them and been like 'dude shut up idk')

Ok so how to break free...

I guess I currently feel like I don't have burning questions. Like, I don't _want_ to, idk, wade into "Israel vs Palestine" twitter and guess at people's takes. Or find people who have been tweeting about Heidegger and ask for clarification...

Maybe I should make an alt so that I can have a different algorithm...

Maybe I need to follow more rationalists. It feels like tpot people aren't saying stuff that is ammeanable to followup questions, more aphorisms and pithy sayings and shit.

Ayyy ok I stumbled across Defender of Basic showing off his good faith alt account, I'm gonna copy it 

[here](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1818091424744698262), OG tweet [here](https://x.com/intogoodfaith/status/1818064676619698686)

I'm gonna set up an alt and follow in his footsteps

Ok an hour or so has passed. I made an alt, asked ChatGPT for some big people to follow (like Elon Musk), so that I can read their replies and find people to engage with. I read into some replies on AOC's tweets and just... this is hard!! It's people who are very polarised, saying talking points that don't seem back up with evidence (e.g. the 13.7 million people who will be removed from Medicare → it's ok because they're all illegals → no they're not, illegal immigrants don't get access to Medicare)

I have a sense that I've started right at the deep end. I think they'll be a calibration period where I get better at picking topics and people... because so far I've just seen kind of mad, very polarised, MAGA people, who are just dunking on people. I can't imagine them replying to me and giving an explanation. But maybe that's a skill issue on my part!

Ok cool, I poked around in AOCs replies for a bit longer and this led to some updates, like (here's my ChatGPT history):
(from people being like "it's the illegals, dumbass!" when she's tweeted about how bad it is that Trump is cutting Medicaid to 13 million americans, and another tweet I saw where someone said the Boulder attack was her fault. Thinking "ok, why would someone claim that AOC is to blame? Because of Democrat immigration policies? Because she's "pro-Hamas"? Etc):

```what happened with the 2025 boulder attack?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Boulder_fire_attack```

```can you give me the years that various presidents were in office, from 2000 onwards```

`how do illegal immigrants get on medicaid? do they?`

```How do American states work with regards to leadership? Like, do you have a head of the state? Thinking about in England, you have an MP, Member of Parliament, but obviously counties are very small and they don't have their own laws. As I know in America, you'd have a state, which would be for a certain party, like California, I assume is Democrat. And then you have like a state leader who sets the laws and policies and stuff for that state, but there's also federal. I just, I don't know much about this.```

# Leaving it there for today

Ok, that's been a 2.5 hour block, it's now noon
Feels like I didn't get many replies on twitter, but I set up the alt, poked around trying to find decent threads to reply to, set up this blog post, etc

Also I tweeted about following in Defender's footsteps and he follows me now, hell yeah
