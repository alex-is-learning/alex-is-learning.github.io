## It's 23:30 and my eyes are fried 

I wrote a substack post today on how I've never quite felt like an effective
altruist. Feels like a great step towards feeling like more of an effective
altruist! Plus I'm fairly certain I'll be going to the conference on Friday.
Wahoo! 

This is a silly short post but I want to keep the magic of my "write a blog post
daily" thing going

[Here's the post!](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/on-being-in-group-tpot-vs-ea). On feeling like a member of the post-rat scene but no the effective altruism scene. Feel like bringing my dumb semi-unconciously held beliefs out into the light is already useful

ok night night!
