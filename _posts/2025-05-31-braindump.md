## Daily post hello world
I'm not sure what I'm going to write about yet. Let's see...

I published the first of my "shame" series, inspired by my friend Delia,
yesterday (to my substack). I love how much of a non-event it feels like. I
feel, with this and with finally hearing back re: the work trial I did (after 23
days), suddenly very light and free. It's the weekend too -- even though I'm
unemployed so weekends don't really mean anything, they still feel very real,
and I like preserving them as non-main-work days.

It's 5pm already somehow, I don't know where the hell the day went. I watched a
John Vervaeke talk in the morning (him at at a conference organised by a
philosophy AI app that he endorses - I forget the name but I've downloaded it
and had a 6-minute call with an AI version of a Greek Philosopher today. I'm
excited to use it more -- I take a Vervaeke cosign very seriously, I think he is
a brilliant man).

I've spent a big chunk of time tweaking my Arch Linux laptop (did I mention I
use Arch Linux?). I've had a few instances now where I write a blog post on my
Arch laptop, and because it's so incredibly basic (by personal design!), I can't
access relevant links, so once I've pushed the changes via git, I have to
remember to edit the code from my Macbook, so I can add links. This is silly
because no one will read this, but also because it's redundant, so now I've made
my Arch laptop more elaborate.

## Adding functionality to the laptop

As of this morning, all this beautiful 13 year old hunk of plastic had on it was
the Linux TTY (I forget what it stands for but basically, a barebones terminal),
and git. 

Now I have an actual desktop setup, the i3 Window/workspace manager, firefox so
I can get to links if I need to e.g. grab a link to a blog post by someone else,
and Obsidian. I may remove Obsidian if it poses a distraction, but I figure it
might be nice, maybe, to be able to access my notes. I'm wary of Sasha Chapin's
[Notes Against Note-Taking
Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems)
here - I don't want Obsidian to distract me and detract from the beautiful
turbo-basic setup I had this morning. So we'll see.

Oh god, currently I can't copy-paste from Firefox (e.g. the URL for that Sasha
post) into this Neovim instance in Alacritty. Let's see what AI has to say about
this...

Ok, time to peace-out from Neovim and install some shit. Gimme 5...

Ok, I'm back.

Ok look, I admit it. Arch Linux is an absolute pain. I just had to spend 10
minutes installing a package and tweaking some config files to make it the case
that I can copy-paste from an app (like Firefox) into Neovim. I think if I was
trying this out a few years ago, before AI, I may have thrown in the towel. But
now AI is here and it's totally fine and actually fun to do, if you don't mind
the setup cost. 

## I can now talk to Gemini 2.5 from my Arch Linux laptop 
Now I have i3, I can actually open apps other than the command line, which is
exciting (for me -- I really hope no one is reading this, lol). 

This still feels like a nice stripped-down laptop. Sure, I can browse the
internet now, but it's relatively slow, the screen is small, the trackpad is
abysmal. I could learn Vimium to browse Firefox without having to use the
trackpad (or the famous ThinkPad nipple), but... I imagine the slow speed will
keep me using this as a "90% neovim, 10% searching for links/checking my github
build" machine. Nice and simple, still. 

## What else to do today
I want to do a big chunk of MathAcademy.com today. I have my beeminder goal set
to 15 mins of MA per day, but I'd like to do maybe 1 hour today. It has me
working through very embarrassingly easy prealgebra, because I did so badly on
the placement exam. 90% if stuff that I vaguely remember learning and can just
intuit, 10% is stuff that I've forgotten or never touched. So it feels pretty
damn inefficient, like they're making me do a huge amount of stuff that I can
just intuit, but I definitely see the value in making sure I have 100% of these
foundations in place before progressing. It's going to be absolutely ages before
I'm doing anything actually useful... I have a vague sense that maths is an
important thing that I missed out on, that maybe linear algebra or calculus will
help me understand the world better, somehow... we'll see. Will I stick to it
long enough to see benefits? I hope so. But I'm definitely doing far too much
right now. 

Ok, I'll leave it there!
